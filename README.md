# Jack-O-Lantern Lab

Recreate the jack-o-lantern gui found in the jar file. Make sure you click on the eyes/mouth!

Here are some hints:

1. The eyes are `Circle` shapes and the mouth is a rotated `Arc` shape.  Both `Cicle` and `Arc` extend the javafx `Shape` class.
2. The color of the shapes is controlled by `setFill`. Setting the value to `Paint.valueOf("#ffff00")` will make the shape yellow.
3. Text visibility can be controlled with the `setVisibility` method.
